+binaural~ is a filter which places a sound at a specific
position around the listener's head. It does this by using
filters which simulate the filtering effect of the head and
outer ear for sounds at all angles. The filters in
+binaural~ are optimized for headphones and are only for 0
degree elevation at a 44100 sample rate.
